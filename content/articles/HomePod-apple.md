A statement announces a release of HomePod for February 9, initially for England, the United States and Australia. Other countries in the world, including France, should follow in the coming months, especially around spring. Online orders will start on January 26th. As a reminder, the Apple HomePod works as its connected competitors and can communicate through his voice with Siri (that iPhone users and other iPads know all too well!).
The known price of HomePod in the United States is $ 349, or â‚¬ 285. Price that could be totally different once the connected speaker is available in France. With its HomePod, Apple promises a reinvented music experience. For this, the speaker can connect to the Apple Music to better manage the songs with a much-awaited sound quality.
