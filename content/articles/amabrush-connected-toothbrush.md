Amabrush sounds the end of classic toothbrushes. She promises to clean the entire mouth in ten seconds against three minutes with a conventional brush. The project is a hit on Kickstater with more than 3,198,000 euros collected.

Much more powerful than a classic toothbrush, the Amabrush has raised more than 3,198,000 euros on Kickstarter. While the sum requested was only 50,000 euros, the revolutionary toothbrush has already gathered more than 26,000 contributors, including 10 who donated 1000 dollars to support the project. The starter pack costs 130 euros, compared to 90 euros on average for a classic electric toothbrush.
The time savings offered by this new toothbrush is considerable. While oral health professionals recommend brushing, teeth in three minutes, the Amabrush offer to achieve an equivalent result in just ten seconds. To achieve this feat, vibrations are generated by the toothbrush. The classic brushing gesture from top to bottom that all dentists advocate does not have to be with this device. No more boredom of the traditional three-minute ritual for clean teeth, the future of the toothbrush is here.
