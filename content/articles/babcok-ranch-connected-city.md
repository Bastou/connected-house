Syd Kitson is an american billionaire who wanted to build a city where every services were connected and accessible to everyone. He has started to create the city “Babcok Ranch” in Florida. The main thing for him was to create an electricity network based on solar energy. He built a solar electric factory. There are also metallic trees with solar panels, located next to homes to supply power to them. Thanks to that, the homes are self-sustaining. In the city, there are also autonomous and connected electric buses.
