How many times a week do you wake up feeling groggy? And how many times do you hit snooze before clambering out of bed? If the answer is more often than not, it's likely you've tried to rectify the issue with either more hours in the sack or a more consistent sleeping pattern. Perhaps you've even employed the help of a sleep tracker to help log how your body is operating during the night.

And if so, you'll already know that trackers aren't necessarily the best solution to help understand the rest your body requires and, in turn, feel more refreshed when you wake up. And it's an issue that Shenzhen-based startup Dreamlight is aiming to tackle head-on - literally.
