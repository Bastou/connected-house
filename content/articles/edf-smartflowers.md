The smartflowers by EDF are solar generators that produce consumable photovoltaic energy for the owners which means that you can create your own electricity. This innovation looks like a flower. Thanks to a solar tracker, it can follow the sun during all the day.

With this installation, you have an app where you can see 24/24 the electricity production curve. The owner can also see informations about his electricityâ€™s consumption in his home. Thanks to those informations, he can adapt his uses and become an actor of his power consumption.
