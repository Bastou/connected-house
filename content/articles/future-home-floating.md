This article is less realistic than the other ones because it’s still  in draft form but it explains an interesting vision of the future’s home. Because 70% of the Earth is covered with water, the floating home is a very feasible solution and even more with the rising of the oceans.
This article shows the example of the architect Luca Curci. He has imagined a Vertical City on the water with apartments, offices, shops, services for 25,000 inhabitants…
The project is to create an eco-responsible floating and connected home. 

The 180-storey tower would have a modular structure that would bring natural ventilation and light into the living units. Aiming to provide an alternative design for a population interested in healthy lifestyles, the architects envisioned the city-building with public gardens along its entire height. Based on a modular 3d network, the structure is enveloped with a membrane of photovoltaic glass, which provides electricity to the whole building and makes it energy-independent.
