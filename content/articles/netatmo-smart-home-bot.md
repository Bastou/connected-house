The French leader in home automation Netatmo presents at CES its first Artificial Intelligence to control your home. The Netatmo Smart Home Bot interacts with you and controls your home, even remotely. The ability to understand the natural language of artificial intelligence allows a much more intuitive and user-friendly interaction than via a dedicated application, which the user must accommodate before using it.
