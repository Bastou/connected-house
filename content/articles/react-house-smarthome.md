“reACT” stands for “Resilient Adaptative Climate Technology”. It’s a project of self-sustaining home targeted at people with traditional culture backgrounds, imagined by an american couple based in Denver, Colorado. This house has been designed by University of Maryland students.

It’s a house conceived as a modular “kit of parts” that can be adapted to a range of uses and homeowners. It joins ecology and technology. For example, it includes a composting system, an hydroponic garden. 

There's a solar power system with photovoltaics and battery storage; water is managed via a rainwater harvesting system and greywater treatment system. The team included tech that would help the home attain "net-zero" water use at a residential level, by recycling water as much as possible. All the home's systems can be adjusted and monitored via smart-home software.

This home is reconciling traditional views of harmonious ecological co-existence with modern technology.
