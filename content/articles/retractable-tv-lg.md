LG unveils a prototype 65-inch screen that folds and rolls up to fit in a piece of furniture. This screen, surprising, will be released in 2020.

A standard size screen that wraps and folds in a drawer, you never thought about it, but LG did it. This is the new gadget of the South Korean company that has just been presented at CES 2018 in Las Vegas. A 65-inch UHD UHD TV that is so flexible that it can roll on itself to be carried everywhere. A curiosity that has aroused the curiosity of all visitors to the show. Beyond the technical prowess, one can wonder the real usefulness of such a product.
