In this article, the author talks about his opinion about design and architecture for 2018. According to him, “we need to look at the upcycle-recycle formula”.

He explains that the use of technology in homes goes far beyond the idea of automation. “Up-cycle and recycle” is the new mantra and designers are coming up with innovative new technologies to achieve this. Sustainability technologies and concerns of ecology are becoming more important in both architecture and design. 

Sustainable practices refers to architectural strategies like the use of solar panels, rain water harvesting, the use of recycled building materials. Those technologies reduce unnecessary consumption of energy and resources. 

He also talks about the fact that today, the consumers are extremely well-informed about the concept of “green homes”. So in 2018, it’s not an option for the smart homes’ engineers : technology and ecology have to live together.
