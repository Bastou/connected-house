			<p>There are a number of different types of smart home technology that are in common use today. These technologies work together
				to automate a number of your home's basic systems, including the electrical system, lighting, security and communication
				systems. Like most technologies, there are good and bad points to smart home technology, and the technology itself has
				not yet arrived at a point where it is without weakness or issues.

			to it but the problem is that we are creating so many connected objects and we are not thinking about the house as a whole.
			The security and the comfort are the main arguments in favour of the connected house but sometimes, those technologies
			may seem really “gadgets”.</p>

				We feel that today, people aren’t really ready to live in a whole connected house because they are not able to trust those
				technologies at 100% in particular in terms of security. But in the future, we think that the smarthouse will be more
				and more customized thanks to the evolution of the AI so it will more easily fit the requirements of a range of users.
