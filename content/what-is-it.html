        <h3>What is it ?</h3>
        <div class="dash"></div>
        <p>The members of our team had to do a “connected home” scanning on internet or another media like TV, Radio, Newspapers
            or conferences. The goal of this eve is to be able to make his own idea of a subject and to expose an anylisis
            and a chronology of the events to an international public. We had to analyze the subject and defined our vision
            of the connected home. This work has started in september and end in 10th April

        <h2>CONNECTED HOUSE</h2>
        <p>A connected home is networked to enable the interconnection and interoperability of multiple devices, services and
            apps, ranging from communications and entertainment to healthcare, security and home automation. These services
            and apps are delivered over multiple interlinked and integrated devices, sensors, tools and platforms. Connected,
            real-time, smart and contextual experiences are provided for the household inhabitants, and individuals are enabled
            to control and monitor the home remotely as well as within it.</p>

        <h2>AUTOMATISATION</h2>
        <p>The smart home is a paradigm (a way of seeing things, often presented as an object of the future and sometimes as
            a fantasy) that positions itself as a successor to home automation.</p>
