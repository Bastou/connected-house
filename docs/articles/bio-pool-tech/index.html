 <p>This article is very interesting because it shows an other vision of the connected home : the connected garden and more precisely, the swimming pool. This project is a creation of the french startup Bio Pool Tech. They wanted to revolutionize swimming pools as well as the innovative technological solution on the whole. According to them, Bio Pool Tech is the swimming pool 3.0 because it’s connected to a smartphone which notifies its users about the proper operation of equipment such as security around the pool.</p>

<p>It allows an autonomous and automatic management of consumables.
But it’s also an ecological innovation because the pool comes with an ecological system of bio-filtration which cuts down the consumption of water and electricity of a normal swimming pool by 75%.
The Bio Pool Tech pools 3.0 are ecological, economical and self contained. The project has been presented during the Las Vegas CES (Consumer Electronic Show) 2018 and the startup got a very positive return.
