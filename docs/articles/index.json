From there, the Piccolo camera is basically looking to record your geometry through what’s called skeletal tracking — don’t worry it’s not using an X-ray or anything — which puts your movement into a model that tracks your body position. From there, the device will know where you’re pointing your hand and can interface with the compatible smart home item. It does more than just turn stuff on and off, they’re experimenting with gestures to fast-forward through a Netflix show, change modes on the fan, etc.\n\u003c!--stackedit_data:\neyJoaXN0b3J5IjpbNDM5MjYyODM4XX0=\n--\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Because 70% of the Earth is covered with water, the floating home is a very feasible solution and even more with the rising of the oceans.\nThis article shows the example of the architect Luca Curci. He has imagined a Vertical City on the water with apartments, offices, shops, services for 25,000 inhabitants…\nThe project is to create an eco-responsible floating and connected home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 180-storey tower would have a modular structure that would bring natural ventilation and light into the living units. Aiming to provide an alternative design for a population interested in healthy lifestyles, the architects envisioned the city-building with public gardens along its entire height. Based on a modular 3d network, the structure is enveloped with a membrane of photovoltaic glass, which provides electricity to the whole building and makes it energy-independent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c!--stackedit_data:\neyJoaXN0b3J5IjpbMjAzNDk0MjgzN119\n--\u003e\n",

According to him, “we need to look at the upcycle-recycle formula”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe explains that the use of technology in homes goes far beyond the idea of automation. “Up-cycle and recycle” is the new mantra and designers are coming up with innovative new technologies to achieve this. Sustainability technologies and concerns of ecology are becoming more important in both architecture and design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSustainable practices refers to architectural strategies like the use of solar panels, rain water harvesting, the use of recycled building materials. Those technologies reduce unnecessary consumption of energy and resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe also talks about the fact that today, the consumers are extremely well-informed about the concept of “green homes”. So in 2018, it’s not an option for the smart homes’ engineers : technology and ecology have to live together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c!--stackedit_data:\neyJoaXN0b3J5IjpbNDc0NDg4NzkzXX0=\n--\u003e\n",

The project is a hit on Kickstater with more than 3,198,000 euros collected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMuch more powerful than a classic toothbrush, the Amabrush has raised more than 3,198,000 euros on Kickstarter. While the sum requested was only 50,000 euros, the revolutionary toothbrush has already gathered more than 26,000 contributors, including 10 who donated 1000 dollars to support the project. The starter pack costs 130 euros, compared to 90 euros on average for a classic electric toothbrush.\nThe time savings offered by this new toothbrush is considerable. While oral health professionals recommend brushing, teeth in three minutes, the Amabrush offer to achieve an equivalent result in just ten seconds. To achieve this feat, vibrations are generated by the toothbrush. The classic brushing gesture from top to bottom that all dentists advocate does not have to be with this device. No more boredom of the traditional three-minute ritual for clean teeth, the future of the toothbrush is here.\n\u003c!--stackedit_data:\neyJoaXN0b3J5IjpbMzQxOTk2NTM5LC02ODAzMzAzNzldfQ==\n--\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Designed by the company of the same name, these are in fact small portable lamps with candle design, connected together through the bluetooth network and the dedicated application. To turn it on, just turn the top, and the others are automatically turned on too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNote that the other projects of the company already work with Google Assistant Alexa and IFTTT, and that candles should also benefit in the short term. They will be able to integrate in your connected home and synchronize with the music or the opening of the doors for example. The autonomy of each model is 8 hours. To recharge a connected Yeelight candle, simply plug it into USB. Easy to do if you have some, a little more problematic if you\u0026rsquo;ve seen things big.Launched on August 1, Yeelight connected candles were funded in less than 48 hours on the Kickstarter platform. In the end, more than $ 115,000 was raised while the initial goal was $ 50,000. A performance made possible thanks to the support of over 270 contributors. If Yeelight candles were offered at $ 35 each, they should be sold at a price of around $ 50. To sum up, a small investment for those who want to fill the house.\n\u003c!--stackedit_data:\neyJoaXN0b3J5IjpbLTcxNjYwODMwOV19\n--\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",
