 <p>What if you could light tens, hundreds or even thousands of candles in one moment? Forget the burns and hards with the lighter, thanks to the connected Yeelight candles. Designed by the company of the same name, these are in fact small portable lamps with candle design, connected together through the bluetooth network and the dedicated application. To turn it on, just turn the top, and the others are automatically turned on too.</p>

<p>Note that the other projects of the company already work with Google Assistant Alexa and IFTTT, and that candles should also benefit in the short term. They will be able to integrate in your connected home and synchronize with the music or the opening of the doors for example. The autonomy of each model is 8 hours. To recharge a connected Yeelight candle, simply plug it into USB. Easy to do if you have some, a little more problematic if you&rsquo;ve seen things big.Launched on August 1, Yeelight connected candles were funded in less than 48 hours on the Kickstarter platform. In the end, more than $ 115,000 was raised while the initial goal was $ 50,000. A performance made possible thanks to the support of over 270 contributors. If Yeelight candles were offered at $ 35 each, they should be sold at a price of around $ 50. To sum up, a small investment for those who want to fill the house.
