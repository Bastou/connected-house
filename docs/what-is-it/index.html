			<h3>What is it ?</h3>
			<div class="dash"></div>
			<p>The members of our team had to do a “connected home” scanning on internet or another media like TV, Radio, Newspapers
				or conferences. The goal of this eve is to be able to make his own idea of a subject and to expose an anylisis and a
				chronology of the events to an international public. We had to analyze the subject and defined our vision of the connected
				home. This work has started in september and end in 10th April

		<h2>CONNECTED HOUSE</h2>
		<p>A connected home is networked to enable the interconnection and interoperability of multiple devices, services and apps,
			ranging from communications and entertainment to healthcare, security and home automation. These services and apps are
			delivered over multiple interlinked and integrated devices, sensors, tools and platforms. Connected, real-time, smart
			and contextual experiences are provided for the household inhabitants, and individuals are enabled to control and monitor
			the home remotely as well as within it.</p>

				What does the house of the future like ? This is a many decades old question that everyone would like an answer. Crazy architecture,
				awesome colors and full of amazing proprieties ? In 1960, plastic was the new best material to build things. The best
				example of this period is the first dom house built only with plastic. Technology was not the priority at that time,
				they were mainly focused on materials and architecture. In 1970, the next big idea was an house which follow the sun.
				This is an house which cans adapt to weather and saves heating costs. It was the emergence of the concept of ecological
				houses.
			</p>
			<p>
				The idea of creating an autonomous house that meets the needs of its inhabitants was already present in the 60s and 70s.
				The evolution of building materials and technologies has managed to take us where we are today. The main progress occurred
				at this time, and it was the beginning of automation at home. But what does home automation mean?
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="right-paragraphe">
			<p>
				We often speak of “smart home” with home automation, and it’s basically because the house is more and more connected to computerized
				systems which allow you to manage your home. Heating, lighting, security, weather, your furnitures… Many elements of
				your home are now manageable remotely or via computer tools. One example can be the fridge which automatically generates
				a shopping list as you empties it. It essentially aims to improve our comfort.

			</p>
			<p>
				A connected house isn’t a big connected object, it is an assembly of several connected objects with different brands, different
				uses, etc…
			</p>

			<p>
				In recent years, we can see several connected products launched every month. Sometimes very innovative, sometimes just “refreshed”,
				they are around us everyday. Currently, the trend is the virtual home assistants like Google Home or Home Pod, sorts
				of IA which looks like a simple speaker but can also help you control all your connected objects by voice.

		<h2>Representation</h2>
		<p>Many science fiction films or superheroes like Blade Runner or Iron Man, present autonomous houses equipped with screens
			everywhere and “real” artificial intelligence. In Blade Runner 2049, Officer K has a hologram built into his flat in order
			to have some company. The connected home as it is perceived now goes beyond the meaning of the simple word "house". AI
			are usually at the center of thoughts, and the connected home would represent only a small part of our daily lives, because
			we would be accompanied at all times by those computerized helps: on our phone, in the car, at work, on the other side
			of the planet...</p>
